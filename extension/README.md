Pylance
=====================
### Fast, feature-rich language support for Python

Pylance is an extension that works alongside Python in Visual Studio Code to provide performant language support. Under the hood, Pylance is powered by [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright), Microsoft's static type checking tool. Using Pyright, Pylance has the ability to supercharge your Python IntelliSense experience with rich type information, helping you write better code faster.

The Pylance name is a small ode to Monty Python's Lancelot who was the first knight to answer the bridgekeeper's questions in the Holy Grail.

Quick Start
============
1. Install the [Pylance extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) from the marketplace.
1. Open a Python (.py) file and the Pylance extension will activate.
1. Select Yes when prompted to make Pylance the default language server. This will update your preferences, which you can also do manually by adding `"python.languageServer": "Pylance"` to your settings.json file using the text editor.

Features
=========

Pylance provides some awesome features for Python 3, including:

* Docstrings
* Signature help, with type information
* Parameter suggestions
* Code completion
* Auto-imports (as well as add and remove import code actions)
* As-you-type reporting of code errors and warnings (diagnostics)
* Code outline
* Code navigation
* Type checking mode
* Native multi-root workspace support
* IntelliCode compatibility
* Jupyter Notebooks compatibility

See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for the latest release.

Settings and Customization
===============
Pylance provides users with the ability to customize their Python language support via a host of settings which can either be placed in the settings.json file in your workspace, or edited through the Settings Editor UI. 

- `python.analysis.typeCheckingMode`
    - Used to specify the level of type checking analysis performed;
    - Default: `off`
    - Available values:
        - `off`: No type checking analysis is conducted; unresolved imports/variables diagnostics are produced
        - `basic`: Non-type checking-related rules (all rules in `off`) + basic type checking rules
        - `strict`:	All type checking rules at the highest severity of error (includes all rules in `off` and `basic` categories)

- `python.analysis.diagnosticMode`
    - Used to allow a user to specify what files they want the language server to analyze to get problems flagged in their code.
    - Available values:
        - `workspace`
        - `openFilesOnly` (default)

- `python.analysis.stubPath`
    - Used to allow a user to specify a path to a directory that contains custom type stubs. Each package's type stub file(s) are expected to be in its own subdirectory.
    - Default value: `./typings`

- `python.analysis.autoSearchPaths`
    - Used to automatically add search paths based on some predefined names (like `src`).
    - Available values:
        - `true` (default)
        - `false`

- `python.analysis.extraPaths`
    - Used to specify extra search paths for import resolution. This replaces the old `python.autoComplete.extraPaths` setting.
    - Default value: empty array

- `python.analysis.diagnosticSeverityOverrides`
    - Used to allow a user to override the severity levels for individual diagnostics should they desire
    - Accepted severity values:
        - `error` (red squiggle)
        - `warning` (yellow squiggle)
        - `information` (blue squiggle)
        - `none` (disables the rule)

    - Available rule to use as keys can be found [here](DIAGNOSTIC_SEVERITY_RULES.md)
    - Example:
    ```
    { 
        "python.analysis.diagnosticSeverityOverrides:" { 
            "reportUnboundVariable" : "information", 
            "reportImplicitStringConcatenation" : "warning" 
        } 
    } 
    ```

- `python.analysis.useLibraryCodeForTypes`
    - Used to parse the source code for a package when a typestub is not found
    - Accepted values:
        - `true` (default)
        - `false`

-   `python.analysis.autoImportCompletions`
    -   Used to control the offering of auto-imports in completions.
    -   Accepted values:
        -   `true` (default)
        -   `false`
